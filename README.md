# expiry_date_scanner

The Expiry Date Scanner is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to scan product expiry dates using OCR technology and inform users whether the product is safe to consume. The app utilizes Text-to-Speech (TTS) for enhanced accessibility, making it easier for users to receive expiry notifications audibly. The project is developed with a clean architecture pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and maintainable code structure.

Features:

1. OCR (Optical Character Recognition): 
 - Extracts dates from product images using Google ML Kit.
 - Supports multiple date formats (DD/MM/YYYY, MM/DD/YYYY, YYYY/MM/DD).
 - Flexible date extraction with user-selected formats.

2. Expiry Date Validation
 - Checks if the extracted date is expired, approaching expiry, or safe to consume.
 - Displays expiry status with color-coded indicators:
    ðŸŸ¢ Green: Safe to consume (More than 7 days left).
    ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Approaching expiry (Less than 7 days left).
    ðŸ”´ Red: Expired.

3. Scan History
 - Stores scanned products locally using Hive for offline access.
 - Lists all scanned products with expiry status and days remaining.

4. Text-to-Speech (TTS)
 - Reads out expiry status and product details for accessibility.
 - Utilizes Flutter TTS package for smooth voice output.

5. Voice Commands
 - Start and stop voice commands for hands-free scanning.
 - Recognizes keywords like "scan" and "pick" for seamless interaction.
 
6. Dark Mode Support
 - Toggle between light and dark themes using Riverpod for state management.

7. Lottie Animations
 - Utilizes Lottie animations for interactive loading indicators, enhancing user experience.

Why This Structure?

1. Clean Separation of Concerns:
    - data/: Handles data sources, including Hive local storage.
    - domain/: Contains pure business logic, independent of Flutter.
    - ui/: Manages presentation logic using Riverpod for state management.

2. Maintainability: Well-organized structure facilitates easy maintenance and scalability.

3. Testability: Decoupled layers make it easier to write unit tests for business logic and data handling.



Implementation Details:

1. OCR Integration
    - ML Kit is integrated using the google_ml_kit package for accurate date extraction.
    - Date formats are normalized to handle multiple formats consistently.

2. State Management with Riverpod

    - Riverpod is used for managing the state of scanned data and theme settings.
    - StateNotifierProvider efficiently updates UI components when state changes.

3. Local Persistence with Hive
    - Scanned products are saved locally using Hive with models stored in data/models.
    - ScanHistoryModel is used for saving and retrieving scan history.

4. Voice Commands and TTS
    - TTS: Reads out expiry status and product details using flutter_tts.
    - Voice Commands: Implemented with speech_to_text for hands-free scanning.

5. Dark Mode Support
    - Utilizes StateNotifierProvider to toggle between light and dark themes.
    - The theme state is persisted using Hive, ensuring consistency across app restarts.

6. Lottie Animations
    - Enhances user experience with interactive loading indicators.
    - Integrated in scan_page.dart for a modern and appealing UI.
